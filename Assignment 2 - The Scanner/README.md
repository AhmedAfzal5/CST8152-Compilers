# The Scanner

## Purpose
To read a source program from a text file and produce and stream of token representations. Use a data strucutre to represent the Token. 
It will be a mixture between transition-table driven (DFA) and token driven scanner. The transition-table driven aspect will recognize only variable identifiers
(including keywords), integer literals (decimal and hexadecimal constants), and floating-point literals.
